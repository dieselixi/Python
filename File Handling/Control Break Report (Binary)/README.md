# Control Break Report (Binary)

 This program involves the creation of a level break report by correctly reading each of the records from a binary data file (cb2data.dat) and then unpacks each record struct, parses the record into fields to produce a control break report to a disk file named "cb2rpt.txt". The programs output will also create an employee level break with each employees total hours as well as a department level break with each departments total hours and a grand total of hours at the end.
