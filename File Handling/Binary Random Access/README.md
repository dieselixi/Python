# Binary Random Access

 This program involves the creation of a  file. The program uses an input loop to obtain data from the user, validates the data , converts the the data into a struct and then stores the data in a a binary random access file. Each time the program is run it will append new data records to the existing file, if no output file exists the program will create one.

binTest.py will test this program by unpacking each record struct and displaying each record in formatted output on the screen.
